Old stranger: Welcome to my humble hut, fellow traveler.
Player 1: Greetings, old man, are you lost too?.
Old stranger: No. I've been expecting you.
Player 1: Me?
Old stranger: Yes, ever since you managed to break your NeuraConnector, you fool.
Player 1: Oh, that's why everything feels so weird...
Old stranger: Indeed, that's not your real body, your consciousness has been loaded to RAM and put into a simulation by your computer. I am a product of that simulation generated based on your interests.
Player 1: So what now, should I just wait until the system reboots?
Old stranger: I don't think the system will ever reboot, and if it does, it will certanly be your end.
Old stranger: Remember, your consciusness has been loaded to RAM, so any system reboot will erase it.
Player 1: WHAT!?!?
Old stranger: The situation is critical, as you may have noticed.
Player 1: So this is it? Is this the end for me? Trapped inside that goddamn computer?
Old stranger: There might be a way out though...
Player 1: HOW?!?! I live alone and no one ever visits me, so no one can know my situation. A little blackout could be the end for me!
Old stranger: It appears as if the bug that trapped you here ocurred while loading the NeuraConnector software into your brain.
Old stranger: If I can get my hands on some of the data that got corrupted during the error, I can write and execute a fix.
Old stranger: However, my data load is too low to do much around here.
Old stranger: But with your help, we should be able to restore the corrupted data and escape this simulation.
Player 1: But how will I find them? This simulation looks huge, and I can barely get around.
Old stranger: There are some chips around that contain the datasets needed to execute certain code blocks. There is one very near, and it should help you get started.
Player 1: I will get it, but how can I find the corrupted data fragments?
Old stranger: I don't know where the rest of the chips are, but I'm sure there is a dataset on them somewhere.
Player 1: I'll be on my way then.
Old stranger: Good luck, Player 1. I'll be waiting for you.
